        DONT THINK!
    </h2>
    <p>While thinking we need our brain for this we have to give it so many connections of nerves which rely upon various other body parts and also with this they need to be connected to blood and since all this get connected and need to transfer something to other this requires energy and since energy is required this is not an energy efficient step.<br>
    That's why stop thinking save energy save planet.<br>
    That's why I have written a short blog so that I do not need to think much but still thinking this much did consume some of my energy and hence even I am not energy efficient element and destroying mother nature.<br>
    <b>DONT THINK</b></p>
